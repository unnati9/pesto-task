# PestoTask (Frontend Assignment) - Angular

## Objective
Building a simple task management application. The application will allow users to create, update, and delete tasks. Tasks have a title, description, due-date, and a status (set to "To Do" on creation) (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done"). Users should also be able to view a list of tasks and filter them by status.
Users need to sign up or login using their credentials to see the tasks.
Users can sort the tasks.

## Hosted Frontend Assignment Link:

## Notes

Currently the users list is hardcoded with dummy users.
